<h2>Description</h2>

This was my first real experience working on a full games development project and working as part of a team. My role here was a lead programmer, where I worked alongside a producer, artist and assisstant programmer/artist. Creating this game was part of my level 4 games development course during my third year at sixth form college; we (and other groups within the class) had the academic year to create a game for a select few local museums as part of an initiative called [Kick The Dust](https://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/join-and-support/kick-the-dust). Our game was made for the Tolhouse Gaol museum, where suspected criminals were tried and held for crimes such as theft, piracy, witchery and more. This rich history is represented within the game, with the likeness of real criminals like Samuel Yarham. The game itself is similar to the dating app Tinder; the user is presented with a suspected criminal and they must decide to jail them within their limited five jail cells, or pardon them at the dissent of the public. If the public becomes unhappy with the player (distrust becomes 100/100), then the player will loose. Periodically, the crown will allow the player to publicly execute one of their prisoners. This is an entertaining event for the public and will increase their trust with the player.

Our group was one of the only within the class to finish their game. A final build was uploaded onto a tablet and placed within the museum for visitors to play. This project gave my invaluable experience working with a team, towards a deadline and for a client, whom we were in regular contact with to ensure the final product was tailored towards them and their museums. Furthermore, this broadened my experience with Unity and C# and generally improved my games development skills.
